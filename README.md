Save The Moon is a Shoot 'Em Up-like game made in 2 weeks.
Only two levels are made so far. I'll probably add more in the future!
This game was made using the SFML library. It was a ton of fun to make! :)

  !! Follow these instructions if you want to try the game !!
    - Copy and paste the dynamic libraries (.dll) from the "bin" file of SFML into YourSolutionPath/x64/Release or YourSolutionPath/x64/Release
    - Have fun!
